- In third iteration, we introduce persistent storage
- We create a wrapper for storage so that the type of storage can changed without modifying todo list code itself and allows unit test to mock operations as necessary - in this case, in-memory storage would do just fine for unit testing
- todo_store.go contains the interface for storage , we also add context argument that is required beyond a simple in-memory storage, the error is getting more complex as there could be more issues when connecting to database
- the folder structure is adjusted to accomodate the tests for 2 different data storage
- added testify library for simplifying assertion
