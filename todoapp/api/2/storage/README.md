- In second iteration, we introduce logging feature
- The logging keeps track the history of the todo operations
- The logging default writer is to standard output, making the unit test still possible without having to mock the IO at this point
- The functions are now converted to methods and the TodoList is now the main container of the todos along with other fields
- There are two constructors with and without options. Currently, there is only one option for logging
