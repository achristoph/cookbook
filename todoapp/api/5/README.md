- In fourth iteration, we add upload and save feature - 
todo items can be uploaded and downloaded from and to the file system
- added StorageIO that is used a wrapper for IO operations so that we can test upload/download without actual operations
git commit --amend --no-edit

Architecture and Design:
Good separation of concerns with clear interfaces (TodoStore, StorageIOInterface)
Well-structured package organization
Good use of dependency injection through constructors
Proper use of interfaces for testing and flexibility
Storage Implementation:
Both SQLite and InMemory implementations are well done
Good use of context for operations
Proper error handling
Thread-safe implementation for InMemoryStore using sync.Map and mutex
HTTP Handlers:
Clean routing setup
Good error handling and status codes
Proper use of context with timeouts
Good JSON handling
Areas for Improvement:
a) Error Handling:
Consider creating custom error types for better error handling and user feedback
Add more specific error messages in the handlers
b) Security:
Add input validation for todo descriptions
Consider adding rate limiting
Add CORS headers if needed
c) Testing:
Add unit tests for handlers
Add integration tests
Add benchmarks for performance testing
d) Documentation:
Add more detailed API documentation
Add examples in the README
Add godoc comments for public functions
e) Features:
Consider adding pagination for GetAllTodos
Add filtering and sorting options
Add user authentication
Add request/response logging middleware
f) Code Organization:
Consider moving handlers to a separate package
Add configuration management
Consider using a router package like gorilla/mux for more complex routing
g) Performance:
Add connection pooling for SQLite
Consider adding caching layer
Add compression for large responses
